# Demo purposes - dummy-agent

This repo contains a dummy sample service that illustrates how [skaffold][skaffold] configuration (`skaffold.yaml`) works to build and automatically re-deploy the application locally on your computer as you move through the development cycle. 

### How it works

The `skaffold.yaml` file defines rules for building and deploying the Dummy service (and some dependencies) in a local Kubernetes cluster ([Minikube][minikube]). Skaffold will automatically pull the service dependencies, listed in the `requires` section of the file, build the application and deploy it to your local environment by running a single command. 

The Dummy service relies on 2 containers: a [redis][redis] container and a [Google Cloud Spanner emulator][spanner-emulator] container. These containers will be used to emulate a production environment in your local machine. 

All running services will be mapped to ports on your local machine so you can access the corresponding containers so you can call the service API, load data into the Cloud spanner emulator or modify entries in the Redis store.

```

### Getting started
* Make sure you have [Docker][docker-install] installed.
* Make sure you have the [Google Cloud SDK][gcloud-sdk] installed.
* Install the `kustomize`, `skaffold`, `minikube` and `kubectl` using `gcloud`
    ```console
    $ gcloud components install kustomize skaffold minikube kubectl
    ```
* Make sure `minikube` is running by issuing the following commands
    ```console 
    # verify running
    $ minikube status
      minikube
      type: Control Plane
      host: Running
      kubelet: Running
      apiserver: Running
      kubeconfig: Configured
      docker-env: in-use

    # or start minikube if it's not running
    $ minikube start
    ```
* Sets up docker env variables for working with Minikube
    ```console
    $ eval $(minikube docker-env)
    ```

* Run the [skaffold][skaffold] development configuration 
    ```console
    $ skaffold dev --port-forward
    ```

    The above command will build and run the sample service an it's dependencies.

### Testing the service from your host machine

Once the services start, they will be mapped to your local ports. The service won't have any data, you can verify this by calling one of the endpoints:

```console
$ curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -i localhost:8080/api/v1/models/abc
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 38
ETag: W/"26-zTcnuDGmLHWE1vIdV9Px3Q9X0YE"
Date: Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:16:22 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5

{"error":"Model 'abc' does not exist"}
```

You can add a record to the redis store as follows:

```console
$ curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -i \
  -X PUT \
  --data '{"version": "v1.1.1", "description": "Nice model"}' localhost:8080/api/v1/models/abc
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 2
ETag: W/"2-vyGp6PvFo4RvsFtPoIWeCReyIC8"
Date: Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:18:37 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```

Issuing the first command again will show the entry we just created:

```console
$ curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -i localhost:8080/api/v1/models/abc
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 47
ETag: W/"2f-Iuj8rToNfhJx54uVnmrZEg0fQPM"
Date: Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:19:42 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5

{"version":"v1.1.1","description":"Nice model"}%
```

### Q&A

#### How to load / modify data in the Cloud Spanner emulator from my host machine ?

* Create a `gcloud configuration` called `spanner-emulator` following these steps:
    ```console
    $ gcloud config configurations create spanner-emulator
    $ gcloud config set auth/disable_credentials true
    $ gcloud config set project your-project-id
    $ gcloud config set api_endpoint_overrides/spanner http://localhost:9020/
    ```

* Install [spanner-cli][spanner-cli].
* Make sure your Cloud Spanner Emulator container is running (`skaffold dev` is running).
* Create a Cloud spanner instance and a database:
    ```console
    # Verify if there are any instances in your configuration
    $ gcloud spanner instances list
    Listed 0 items.

    # Create an instance in the spanner emulator
    $ gcloud spanner instances create test-instance \
      --config=emulator-config \
      --description="Test instance" \
      --nodes 1

    # Create a database from a schema file in the test-instance
    $ gcloud spanner databases create song-db \
      --instance test-instance \
      --ddl-file ./spanner-dds/schema.sql
    ```

#### How can I monitor what is going on in the Redis store ? 

Redis has a convenient command called `monitor`. You can get shell into the redis container and run the `monitor` command from the redis CLI. It will print the corresponding output for every command that runs against the redis container.

```console
# Make sure you are talking to the right daemon
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)

# Find the container running redis
$ docker ps | grep redis
b90bf4fe93e3   eb705d309426             "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   44 seconds ago   Up 43 seconds                          k8s_redis_redis-64c5d46d46-gpx4m_dev-agents_ebd15cc3-...

# exec into the container using the ID
$ docker exec -ti b90bf4fe93e3 redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> monitor
OK
```

#### How can I diagnose issues with skaffold ?

You can use the `--verbosity` flag to switch between more verbose output of the command:

```console
$ skaffold dev --verbosity debug
```

#### I keep getting "Skipping deploy due to sync error: copying files: didn't sync any files"

This is an existing [Skaffold issue](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/issues/4246). To work around this you need to make sure that the Kubernetes `namespace` in your current Minikube context, matches the `namespace` to which you are syncing files.


## GKE Cluster deployment

The following diagram describes the architecture of a GKE deployment of the `Dummy Agent`. The architecture can be replied for as many environments it is required as long as there is appropriate access control in place for the Google Cloud Secrets for each environment.

```text
                                               |
  [ GKE namespace: development / qa]           |  [ Other GCP services ] 
                                               |
        +-----------------+                    |    +---------------+
        |  Dummy Agent    |------------------------>| Cloud Secrets |
        |  + wk identity  |                    |    +---------------+
        +-----------------+                    |
                |     |                        |    +---------------+
                |     +---------------------------->| Cloud Spanner |
                |                              |    +---------------+
                |                              |
                |                              |    +---------------+
                +---------------------------------->| Memory Store  |
                                               |    +---------------+
```

The CD pipeline [Github Actions][github-actions], will:
* Deploy to the `development` Kubernetes namespace on merges to the `main` branch.
* Deploy to the `qa` Kubernetes namespace on tags including the `-qa` suffix. ie. `v0.0.1-qa`.
* A [workload identity][k8s-workload-identity] mapped to the deployment enables the container to communicate to both, Cloud Secret Manager and Cloud Spanner.
* The `Dummy Agent` will connect to the [Google Cloud Secret manager][gcloud-secret-manager] on startup to fetch any secrets it requires at runtime.
* The  `Dummy Agent` will connect to a Redis instance living in the [Google Memory Store][memory-store] using a credential obtained from the Cloud Secret Manager.
